Requirements

1. Python Libraries
  pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
  matplotlib: For basic plotting and visualizations.
  seaborn: For advanced data visualizations (like heatmaps, boxplots).
  scikit-learn: For encoding categorical data.

2. Dataset Requirements
  Data Source: A CSV dataset (figure-14-he-student-enrolments-by-subject-area-and-sex-2013-14-to-2017-18-8.csv) containing the following columns:
  Subject Area
  First Year Marker
  Level of Study
  Mode of Study
  Country of HE Provider
  Sex
  Academic Year
  Number (of students enrolled)

3. Data Cleaning Requirements
  Remove Irrelevant or Aggregate Rows: Rows containing summary values like 'Total', 'All', or similar aggregate rows need to be removed. These include:
  'Total' in Subject Area.
  'All' in Level of Study, Mode of Study, Country of HE Provider, Sex.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables
  Label Encoding: Categorical variables like Subject Area, Level of Study, etc., need to be encoded into numeric format before applying any correlation analysis.

5. Handling Numeric Data
  Ensure the Number column is fully numeric

6. Correlation Analysis
  Heatmap: Visualizing the correlation between numeric columns using a heatmap.

7. Visualization for EDA
  Histograms, bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps to explore distributions, relationships, and trends over time.
